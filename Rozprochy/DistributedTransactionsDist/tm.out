12-06-19 12:25:37,146 [main] This method needs a transaction for the calling thread and none exists.
Possible causes: either you didn't start a transaction,
it rolledback due to timeout, or it was committed already.
ACTIONS: You can try one of the following: 
1. Make sure you started a transaction for the thread.
2. Make sure you didn't terminate it yet.
3. Increase the transaction timeout to avoid automatic rollback of long transactions;
   check http://www.atomikos.com/Documentation/JtaProperties for how to do this.
